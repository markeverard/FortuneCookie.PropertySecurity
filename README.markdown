FortuneCookie.PropertySecurity
===============

The PropertySecurity module for EPiServer allows developer managed user and role based security for individual page properties, using attributes placed on PageTypeBuilder strongly typed page types.Page Type Builder allows developers to define EPiServer page types in code which eliminates the need to synchronize page types between different servers. As page types are declared in code it also enables inheritance between page types and strongly typed property access.
